\format{
Elements of aemet:\cr \code{..$df:} Data frame with information of
each wheather station:
\itemize{
\item \code{ind:} Indicated weather station.
\item  \code{name:} Station Name.  36 marked UTF-8 strings.
\item  \code{province:}Province (region) of Spain. 36 marked UTF-8 strings
\item \code{altitude:} Altitude of the station (in meters).
\item   \code{year.ini:} Start year.
\item  \code{year.end:} End year.
\item  \code{longitude:} x geographic coordinate of the station (in decimal degrees).
\item  \code{latitude:} y geographic coordinate of the station (in decimal degrees).
}
The functional variables: 
\itemize{
\item  \code{...$temp}: mean curve of the average daily temperature
for the period 1980-2009 (in degrees Celsius, marked with UTF-8 string).
In leap years temperatures for February 28 and 29 were averaged.
\item \code{...$wind.speed}: mean curve of the average daily wind speed for the
period 1980-2009 (in m/s).
\item  \code{...$logprec}: mean curve of the log precipitation for
the period 1980-2009 (in log mm). Negligible precipitation 
(less than 1 tenth of mm) is replaced by \code{0.05} and no precipitation
(0.0 mm) is replaced by \code{0.01}.  Then the logarithm is applied.

The data were obtained from the FTP of AEMET in 2009.
