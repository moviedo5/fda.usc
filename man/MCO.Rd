\description{
The mithochondiral calcium overload (MCO) was measured in two groups
(control and treatment) every 10 seconds during an hour in isolated mouse
cardiac cells. In fact, due to technical reasons, the original experiment
[see Ruiz-Meana et al. (2000)] was performed twice, using both the "intact",
original cells and "permeabilized" cells (a condition related to the
mitochondrial membrane).
}
\note{
The structure of the curves during the initial period (first 180
seconds) of the experiment shows a erratic behavior (not very relevant in
the experiment context) during this period.
